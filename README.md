This site is built based on the [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale) theme, which itself relies on [Bootstap](http://getbootstrap.com), [Font-Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com). Source code is highlighted with the awesome [Prism](http://prismjs.com).
